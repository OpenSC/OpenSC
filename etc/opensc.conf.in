		# (max_virtual_slots/slots_per_card) limits the number of readers

		# By default, the OpenSC PKCS#11 module will not lock your card
		# once you authenticate to the card via C_Login.
		#
		# Thus the other users or other applications is not prevented
		# from connecting to the card and perform crypto operations
		# (which may be possible because you have already authenticated
		# with the card). This setting is not very secure.
		#
		# Also, if your card is not locked, you can enconter problems
		# due to limitation of the OpenSC framework, that still is not
		# thoroughly tested in the multi threads environment.
		#
		# Your settings will be more secure if you choose to lock your
		# card. Nevertheless this behavior is a known violation of PKCS#11
		# specification. Now once one application has started using your
		# card with C_Login, no other application can use it, until
		# the first is done and calls C_Logout or C_Finalize. In the case
		# of many PKCS#11 application this does not happen until you exit
		# the application.
		# Thus it is impossible to use several smart card aware applications
		# at the same time, e.g. you cannot run both Firefox and Thunderbird at
		# the same time, if both are configured to use your smart card.

		# Symbolic names of PINs for which slots are created

		#   like FireFox. This configuration parameter allows to select the PINs or on-card application
		#   for which PKCS#11 slot will be created.
		# Actually recognised following symbolic names:
		#  'user', 'sign', 'application', all
		# Only PINs initialised, non-SoPIN, non-unblocking are associated with symbolic name.
		# 'user' is identified as first global or first local PIN.
		# 'sign' is identified as second PIN: first local, second global or second local.
		# 'application' slot created for each on-card application,
		#   even if they use a common global PIN.
		# 'all' slot created for all non-sopin, non-unblocking PINs,
		#   optionally for PUK (see option 'create_puk_slot')
