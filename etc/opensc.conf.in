		# are not allowed to change the length of the slot list.
		# Default: true
		# plug_and_play = false;

		# Maximum Number of virtual slots.
		# If there are more slots than defined here,
		# the remaining slots will be hidden from PKCS#11.
		# Default: 16
		# max_virtual_slots = 32;

		# Maximum number of slots per smart card.
		# If the card has fewer keys than defined here,
		# the remaining number of slots will be empty.
		# Default: 4
		# slots_per_card = 2;

		# (max_virtual_slots/slots_per_card) limits the number of readers
		# that can be used on the system. Default is then 16/4=4 readers.

		# Normally, the pkcs11 module will create
		# the full number of slots defined above by
		# num_slots. If there are fewer pins/keys on
		# the card, the remaining keys will be empty
		# (and you will be able to create new objects
		# within them).
		# Default: true
		# hide_empty_tokens = false;

 		# By default, the OpenSC PKCS#11 module will lock your card
 		# once you authenticate to the card via C_Login.
 		# This is to prevent other users or other applications
 		# from connecting to the card and perform crypto operations
 		# (which may be possible because you have already authenticated
 		# with the card). Thus this setting is very secure.
		#
		# This behavior is a known violation of PKCS#11 specification,
		# and is forced due to limitation of the OpenSC framework.
 		#
 		# However now once one application has started using your
 		# card with C_Login, no other application can use it, until
 		# the first is done and calls C_Logout or C_Finalize.
 		# In the case of many PKCS#11 application this does not happen
		# until you exit the application.  
 		#
 		# Thus it is impossible to use several smart card aware
 		# applications at the same time, e.g. you cannot run both
 		# Firefox and Thunderbird at the same time, if both are
 		# configured to use your smart card.
 		#
		# Default: true
		# lock_login = false;

		# Normally, the pkcs11 module will not cache PINs
		# presented via C_Login. However, some cards
		# may not work properly with OpenSC; for instance
		# when you have two keys on your card that get
		# stored in two different directories.
		#
		# In this case, you can turn on PIN caching by setting
		# cache_pins = true
		#
		# Default: true
		# cache_pins = false;

		# Set this value to true if you want to allow off-card
		# keypair generation (in software on your pc)
