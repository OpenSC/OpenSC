# Parameters for the OpenSC PKCS11 module
app opensc-pkcs11 {
	pkcs11 {
		# Maximum Number of virtual slots.
		# If there are more slots than defined here,
		# the remaining slots will be hidden from PKCS#11.
		# Default: 16
		# max_virtual_slots = 32;

		# Maximum number of slots per smart card.
		# If the card has fewer keys than defined here,
		# the remaining number of slots will be empty.
		# Default: 4
		# slots_per_card = 2;

		# (max_virtual_slots/slots_per_card) limits the number of readers
		# that can be used on the system. Default is then 16/4=4 readers.

		# Normally, the pkcs11 module will create
		# the full number of slots defined above by
		# num_slots. If there are fewer pins/keys on
		# the card, the remaining keys will be empty
		# (and you will be able to create new objects
		# within them).
		# Default: true
		# hide_empty_tokens = false;

		# By default, the OpenSC PKCS#11 module will not lock your card
		# once you authenticate to the card via C_Login.
		#
		# Thus the other users or other applications is not prevented
		# from connecting to the card and perform crypto operations
		# (which may be possible because you have already authenticated
		# with the card). This setting is not very secure.
		#
		# Also, if your card is not locked, you can enconter problems
		# due to limitation of the OpenSC framework, that still is not
		# thoroughly tested in the multi threads environment.
		#
		# Your settings will be more secure if you choose to lock your
		# card. Nevertheless this behavior is a known violation of PKCS#11
		# specification. Now once one application has started using your
		# card with C_Login, no other application can use it, until
		# the first is done and calls C_Logout or C_Finalize. In the case
		# of many PKCS#11 application this does not happen until you exit
		# the application.
		# Thus it is impossible to use several smart card aware applications
		# at the same time, e.g. you cannot run both Firefox and Thunderbird at
		# the same time, if both are configured to use your smart card.
		#
		# Default: false
		# lock_login = true;

		# By default, interacting with the OpenSC PKCS#11 module may change the
		# state of the token, e.g. whether a user is logged in or not.
		#
		# Thus other users or other applications may change or use the state of
		# the token unknowingly. Other applications may create signatures
		# abusing an existing login or they may logout unnoticed.
		#
		# With this setting enabled the login state of the token is tracked and
		# cached (including the PIN). Every transaction is preceeded by
		# restoring the login state.  After every transaction a logout is
		# performed. This setting by default also enables `lock_login` (see
		# above) to disable access for other applications during the atomic
		# transactions.
		#
		# Please note that any PIN-pad should be disabled (see `enable_pinpad`
		# above), because the user would have to input his PIN for every
		# transaction.
		#
		# Default: false
		# atomic = true;

		# With this setting disabled, the OpenSC PKCS#11 module will initialize
		# the slots available when the application calls `C_GetSlotList`. With
		# this setting enabled, the slots will also get initialized when
		# C_GetSlotInfo is called.
		#
		# This setting is a workaround for Java which does not call
		# `C_GetSlotList` when configured with a static `slot` instead of
		# `slotListIndex`.

		# List of readers to ignore
		# If any of the strings listed below is matched (case sensitive) in a reader name,

		# Symbolic names of PINs for which slots are created
		# Card can contain more then one PINs or more then one on-card application with
		#   its own PINs. Normally, to access all of them with the PKCS#11 API a slot has to be
		#   created for all of them. Many slots could be ennoying for some of widely used application,
		#   like FireFox. This configuration parameter allows to select the PIN(s)
		#   for which PKCS#11 slot will be created.
		# Actually recognised following symbolic names:
		#  'user', 'sign', 'all'
		# Only PINs initialised, non-SoPIN, non-unblocking are associated with symbolic name.
		# 'user' is identified as first global or first local PIN.
		# 'sign' is identified as second PIN: first local, second global or second local.
		# 'all' slot created for all non-sopin, non-unblocking PINs,
		#   optionally for PUK (see option 'create_puk_slot')
		#
		# Default: all
		# create_slots_for_pins = "user,sign";
		# create_slots_for_pins = "sign";
		#
		# For the module to simulate the opensc-onepin module behavior the following option
		# must be set:
