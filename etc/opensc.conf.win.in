		# the first is done and calls C_Logout or C_Finalize. In the case
		# of many PKCS#11 application this does not happen until you exit
		# the application.

		# the same time, if both are configured to use your smart card.

		#   for which PKCS#11 slot will be created.
		# Actually recognised following symbolic names:
		#  'user', 'sign', 'application', all
		# Only PINs initialised, non-SoPIN, non-unblocking are associated with symbolic name.
		# 'user' is identified as first global or first local PIN.
		# 'sign' is identified as second PIN: first local, second global or second local.
