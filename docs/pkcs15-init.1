pkcs15-init \- smart card personalization utility
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*(nm(1) utility can be used to create a PKCS #15
structure on a smart card, and add key or certificate
objects. Details of the structure that will be created
are controlled via profiles. When invoking \*(nm,
the user must specify the application profile using the
.B \-p
switch. Currently, there is only one supported profile,
which is
.BR pkcs15 .
.SH MODES OF OPERATION
.SS Initialization
This is the first step during card personalization, and
will create the basic files on the card, and initialize
user PINs. To create the initial PKCS #15 structure,
invoke the utility as
.PP
.B "   pkcs15-init --create-pkcs15
.PP
You will then be asked for several PINs (secret codes used to protect
e.g. keys stored on the card), and PUKs. PUKs are secret codes that can
be used to
.I unblock
a PIN if too many incorrect values have been entered in a row.
.PP
If the card supports it, you can also request that the card is erased
prior to creating the PKCS #15 structure, by specifying the
.B --erase-card
option.
.SS Key Generation
\*(nm lets you generate a new key and store it on the card.
You can do this using:
.PP
.BI "   pkcs15-init --generate-key " keyspec
.PP
where
.I keyspec
describes the algorithm and length of the key to be created,
such as
.BR rsa/512 .
This will create a 512 bit RSA key. Currently, only RSA key
generation is supported. Note that cards usually support just
a few different key lengths. Almost all cards will support
512 and 1024 bit keys, some will support 768 or 2048 as well.
.PP
In addition to storing the private portion of the key on the
card, \*(nm will also store the the public portion of the key
as a PKCS #15 public key object.
.PP
On-board key generation is not supported at the moment.
.SS Private Key Download
You can use a private key generated by other means and download
it to the card. For instance, to download a private key contained
in a file named
.B okir.pem ,
which is in PEM format, you would use
.PP
.B  "    pkcs15-init --store-private-key okir.pem --id 45
.PP
If the key is protected by a pass phrase, \*(nm will prompt
you for a pass phrase to unlock the key.
.PP
In addition to storing the private portion of the key on the
card, \*(nm will also store the the public portion of the key
as a PKCS #15 public key object.
.PP
Note the use of the
.B --id
option. The current
.B pkcs15
profile defines two key templates, one for authentication (key ID 45),
and one for non-repudiation purposes (key ID 46). Other key
templates will probably be added in the future. Note that you don't
specify a key ID, \*(nm will pick just the first key template
defined by the profile.
.PP
In addition to the PEM key file format, \*(nm also supports DER encoded
keys, and PKCS #12 files. The latter is the file format used by
Netscape Navigator (among others) when exporting certificates to
a file. Since PKCS #12 files usually contains the X.509 certificate
corresponding to the private key, \*(nm will store the certificate
instead of the public key portion.
.SS Public Key Download
You can also download individual public keys to the card using
the
.B \-\-store-public-key
option, which takes a filename as an argument. This file is supposed
to contain the public key. If you don't specify a key file format
using the
.B \-\-format
option, \*(nm will assume PEM format.
The only other supported public key file format is DER.
.PP
Since the corresponding public keys are always downloaded
automatically when generating a new key, or when downloading a
private key, you will probably use this option only very rarely.
.SS Certificate Download
You can download certificates to the card using the
.B \-\-store-certificate
option, which takes a filename as an argument. This file is supposed
to contain the DER encoded X.509 certificate.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-profile " \fIname\fP, " \-p " \fIname\fP"
Tells \*(nm to load the specified general profile. Currently, the
only application profile defined is
.BR pkcs15 ,
but you can write your own profiles and specify them using this
option.
.TP
.BR \-\-card-profile " \fIname\fP, " \-c " \fIname\fP"
Tells \*(nm to load the specified card profile option.
.TP
.BR \-\-create-pkcs15 ", " \-C
This tells \*(nm to create a PKCS #15 structure on the card, and
initialize any PINs.
.TP
.BR \-\-erase-card ", " \-E
This will erase the card prior to creating the PKCS #15 structure,
if the card supports it. If the card does not support erasing,
\*(nm will fail.
.TP
.BR \-\-generate-key " \fIkeyspec\fP, " \-G " \fIkeyspec\fP
Tells the card to generate new key and store it on the card.
.I keyspec
consists of an algorithm name (currently, the only supported
name is
.BR RSA ),
optionally followed by a slash and the length of the key in bits.
It is a good idea to specify the key ID along with this
command, using the
.BR \-\-id " option.
.TP
.BR \-\-store-private-key " \fIfilename\fP, " -S " \fIfilename\fP"
Tells \*(nm to download the specified private key to the card.
This command will also create a public key object containing
the public key portion.
By default, the file is assumed to contain the key in PEM format.
Alternative formats can be specified using
.BR \-\-format .
It is a good idea to specify the key ID along with this
command, using the
.BR \-\-id " option.
.TP
.BR \-\-store-public-key " \fIfilename\fP, " -P " \fIfilename\fP"
Tells \*(nm to download the specified public key to the card
and create a public key object with the key ID specified via the
.BR \-\-id " option.
By default, the file is assumed to contain the key in PEM format.
Alternative formats can be specified using
.BR \-\-format .
.TP
.BR \-\-store-certificate " \fIfilename\fX, " -P " \fIfilename\fP"
Tells \*(nm to store the certificate given in
.I filename
on the card, creating a certificate object with the ID specified
via the 
.BR \-\-id " option. The file is assumed to contain the
DER encoded certificate.
.TP
.BR \-\-pin1 ", " \-\-pin1 ", " \-\-puk2 ", " \-\-puk2
These options can be used to specify PIN values on the
command line. Note that on most operation systems, any
user can display the command line of any process on the
system using utilities such as
.BR ps (1).
Therefore, you should use these options only on a secured
system, or in an options file specified with
.BR \-\-options-file .
.TP
.BR \-\-passphrase
When downloading a private key,
this option can be used to specify the pass phrase to unlock
the private key. The same caveat applies here as in the
case of the
.B \-\-pin
options.
.TP
.BI \-\-options-file " filename"
Tells \*(nm to read additional options from
.IR filename .
The file is supposed to contain one long option per line, without
the leading dashes, for instance:
.IP
.nf
  pin1          frank
  pin2          zappa
.fi
.PP
You can specify
.B \-\-options-file
several times.
.TP
.BR \-\-debug ", " \-d
Turns on debugging output. Specifying this option more than once
increases the verbosity of the output.
