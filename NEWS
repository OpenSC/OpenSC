  configuration file entry.
* #229: Support semi-automatic fixes to cards personalized with older and
  broken OpenSC versions.
* Software keys removed from pkcs15-init and the PKCS#11 module. OpenSC
  can either generate keys on card or import plaintext keys to the card, but

  as it is no longer needed.
* Improved debugging support: debug level 3 will show everything
  except of ASN1 and card matching debugging (usualy not needed).
* Massive changes to libopensc. This library is now internal, only
  used by opensc-pkcs11.so and command line tools. Header files are
  no longer installed, library should not be used by other applications.
  Please use generic PKCS#11 interface instead.
* #include file statements cleaned up: first include "config.h", then
  system headers, then additional libraries, then headers in opensc
  (but from other directories), then header files from same directory.
  Fix path to reference headers, remove src/include/ directory.
* Various source code fixes and improvements.
* OpenSC now depends on xsltproc utility and docbook-xsl to build docs and man
* Remove iconv dependency. EstEID driver now uses the commonName from the
  certificate for card label.
* Possibility to change the default behavior for card resets via
  opensc.conf.
