<p>
PuTTYcard is an extension to PuTTY, the free SSH-client
from Simon Tatham. With this extension PuTTY can use
RSA-keys from external devices, ie. smart cards, usb-tokens.
</p>
<p>
If pageant is called with one argument, it will interpret
this argument as the name of a key-file. Pageant will then
load this ppk-file into its keylist, or if another instance of
Pageant is already running into the keylist of that instance.
</p>
<p>
The pageant-version from PuTTYcard-0.58-V1.2.zip (can be downloaded
from OpenSCs contrib area) will do exactly the same thing
with one exception. If the first line of the ppk-file
has the form:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">PuTTYcard,&lt;path to DLL&gt;,&lt;arguments for the DLL&gt;
</pre><p>
then Pageant will NOT read the key from the ppk-file. Instead
it loads the DLL and calls a function from that DLL passing
the arguments from the ppk-file to this function.
</p>
<p>
The function may then fetch a public RSA key from any
source. Possbile choices are: files, smart cards, PKCS11
libraries, Cryptographic Service Providers, etc.
</p>
<p>
PuTTYcard-0.58-V1.2.zip contains PuTTYiso7816.dll. This
DLL will load an RSA key from any ISO-7816-8 compatible
smart card. PuTTYiso7816 need additional information
from the ppk-file, namely the location of the RSA key
on your specific smartcard.
</p>
<p>
This information is given as 4 hexadecimal numbers, i.e.
your ppk-file should look like
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">PuTTYcard,PuTTYiso7816.dll,&lt;path&gt;,AA,BB,CCCC
</pre><p>
&lt;path&gt; is the DF on your smart card that contains the RSA-key.
This must be specified as a 4,8,12 or 16digit hexadecimal
number. Do NOT prefix the path with 3F00.
AA is the key-reference of the private key, BB is the
pin-reference of the pin that protects your private key.
CCCC is the ID of a file on your card that contains your
public key. This file must either contain the public key
as two ASN1-encoded records or it must be a certificate file
from which the pulic key will be extracted.
</p>
<h3>How do I find the above mentiones numbers?</h3>
<p>
One of the first actions of PuTTYcard
is to change its working DF to the DF given by the
<strong>&lt;path&gt;</strong>-argument. The remaining information 
(private and public key, PIN and maybe a certificate)
will then be read from that DF. Try <strong>pkcs15-tool -k</strong>
to list all of your keys and that should give you the
information you need.
</p>

Here's the output for my Netkey E4 card:

This card has three keys all of which are stored in DF <strong>DF01</strong>.
This is your &lt;path&gt;-value. Do not include the last component of the
path from the <strong>pkcs15-tool</strong>-output as this is the ID of the
private key itself.
</p>
<p>
The next information you need is the key reference. This value
is included as a decimal number in the above output (ie. 128, 130 and 129).
This value must be converted to a 2-digit hexadcimal number. Let's
use the second key, so your AA-value is 82.
</p>
<p>
Your private key is protected by a PIN and the <strong>pkcs15-tool -k</strong>-output
contains the Auth-ID of this PIN. Here it is 04. This is not
your PIN-reference. Use <strong>pkcs15-tool --list-pins</strong> to list all
your PINs and use the PIN-reference of the PIN that has the same Id
as the Auth-Id of your key.

Again the PIN-reference is given in decimal (here it is 129) and must be
converted to a 2-digit hexdecimal number, namely 81. This is
your BB-value.
</p>
<p>
Finally you need the file-ID of the public key or a certificate file
from which he public key could be extracted.
</p>
<p>
So either use <strong>pkcs15-tool --list-public-keys</strong> or
<strong>pkcs15-tool -c</strong>. With my Netkey card <strong>pkcs15-tool --list-public-keys</strong>
does not show any keys. This is because my Netkey card
contains the public key, but it cannot be used for cryptographic
operations. From other sources (ie. card doku) I know that
the public key is stored in file DF01:4571, so one possible
CCCC-value is 4571.

<p>
If I list all my certificates I get:

A certificate contains the right public key, if it has the
same ID as the private key (here 02). My card has two such
certificates namely DF01:C100 and DF01:4371 so two other
possible CCCC-values are C100 and 4371
</p>
<p>
On a Netkey card a private key may be protected by more than
one PIN. So instead of PIN-reference 81 (which references 
local PIN1) I may alternatively use PIN-reference 00 (which
references global PIN0)
</p>
<p>
So all of the following six lines will work:
