<p>
Unfortunatly not all cards allow to replace a certificate with a new one.
Here is a small HOWTO for Aladdin eToken PRO (should work with any cardos card).
</p>
<p>
1. Create a new certificate. If it's a self signed certificate, don't forget to add the -days attribute, else you'll have to do this process very often.
</p>
<p>
2. If you have the certificate PEM encoded (this is very likely if you use the default settings of openssl) then convert it to DER encoded:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">$ openssl x509 -in mycert.pem -outform DER -out mycert.der
</pre><p>
3. Now get the path of the certificate:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve"> $ pkcs15-tool -c
X.509 Certificate [Certificate]
        Flags    : 2
        Authority: no
        Path     : 3F0050154301
        ID       : 45

</pre><p>
The path here is: 3F0050154301
</p>
<p>
4. open up opensc-explorer
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">OpenSC &gt; cd 5015
</pre><p>
5.  present the valid key for the certificate file, usually the normal pin. You can get info about wich pin to use by executing:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">OpenSC &gt; info [EF]
</pre><p>
where [EF] is the name of the cert EF (in the above example 4301)
</p>
<p>
You'll need the key in hexadecimal format, an example how to convert it:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve"> $ export HISTFILE=
 $ php -r 'echo bin2hex("pssword")."\n";'
707373776f7264
</pre><p>
You'll have to add the colons manually. If your password is shorter than 8 characters, fill it up with 00-s. So with the above example you enter at the opensc-explorer:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">OpenSC &gt; verify CHV3 70:73:73:77:6f:72:64:00
</pre><p>
Code correct.
</p>
<p>
6. Now you can load the data from the DER encoded file into the EF on the card:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">OpenSC &gt; put 4301 mycert.der
</pre><p>
If you get no errors, then you're done.
</p>
<p>
Remarks:
</p>
<ul><li>This isn't the preferred way for everyday users to replace the certificates. Maybe this isn't even for the user's mailing list, but I couldn't find any description how to solve this dangerous yet very urging problem.
</li></ul><ul><li>This may not work on some cards.
</li></ul><ul><li>Since the key isn't changed, after replacing the old certificate you
</li></ul><p>
_won't_ need to replace your .eid/authorized_certificates, or .ssh/authorized_keys files.
</p>
<ul><li>I had to delete the contents of the .eid/cache/ directory for Mozilla to see the new certificate correctly.
</li></ul><p>
Thanks to  Attila Nagy for this information.
