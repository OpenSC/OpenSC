		<title>Description</title>
		<para>
			The <command>pkcs15-init</command> utility can be used to create a PKCS #15
			structure on a smart card, and add key or certificate objects. Details of the
			structure that will be created are controlled via profiles.
		</para>
		<para>
			The profile used by default is <command>pkcs15</command>. Alternative
			profiles can be specified via the <option>-p</option> switch.
		</para>

		<title>PIN Usage</title>
		<para>
			<command>pkcs15-init</command> can be used to create a PKCS #15 structure on
			your smart card, create PINs, and install keys and certificates on the card.
			This process is also called <emphasis>personalization</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
			An OpenSC card can have one security officer PIN, and zero or more user PINs.
			PIN stands for Personal Identification Number, and is a secret code you need
			to present to the card before being allowed to perform certain operations,
			such as using one of the stored RSA keys to sign a document, or modifying
			the card itself.
		</para>
		<para>
			Usually, PINs are a sequence of decimal digits, but some cards will accept
			arbitrary ASCII characters. Be aware however that using characters other
			than digits will make the card unusable with PIN pad readers, because those
			usually have keys for entering digits only.
		</para>
		<para>
			The security officer (SO) PIN is special; it is used to protect meta data
			information on the card, such as the PKCS #15 structure itself. Setting
			the SO PIN is optional, because the worst that can usually happen is that
			someone finding your card can mess it up. To extract any of your secret
			keys stored on the card, an attacker will still need your user PIN, at
			least for the default OpenSC profiles. However, it is possible to create
			card profiles that will allow the security officer to override user PINs.
		</para>
		<para>
			For each PIN, you can specify a PUK (also called <emphasis>unblock PIN</emphasis>).
			The PUK can be used to overwrite or unlock a PIN if too many incorrect values
			have been entered in a row.
		</para>
		<para>
			For some cards that use the PKCS#15 emulation, the attributes of private objects 
			are protected and cannot be parsed without authentication (usually with User PIN).
			This authentication need to be done immediately after the card binding.
			In such cases <option>--verify-pin</option> has to be used.
		</para>

		<title>Modes of operation</title>
		<refsect2>
			<title>Initialization</title>
			<para>This is the first step during card personalization, and will create the
				basic files on the card. To create the initial PKCS #15 structure, invoke the
				utility as
			</para>
			<para>
				<command>pkcs15-init --create-pkcs15</command></para>
			<para>
				You will then be asked for the security officer PIN and PUK. Simply
				pressing return at the SO PIN prompt will skip installation of an SO PIN.
			</para>
			<para>
				If the card supports it, you should erase the contents of the card with
				<command>pkcs15-init --erase-card</command> before creating the PKCS#15 structure.	
			</para>
		</refsect2>

		<refsect2>
			<title>User PIN Installation</title>
			<para>
				Before installing any user objects such as private keys, you need at least one
				PIN to protect these objects. you can do this using
			</para>
			<para>
				<command>pkcs15-init --store-pin --id " nn</command>
			</para>
			<para>
				where <emphasis>nn</emphasis> is a PKCS #15 ID in hexadecimal notation. Common
				values are 01, 02, etc.
			</para>
			<para>
				Entering the command above will ask you for the user's PIN and PUK. If you do
				not wish to install an unblock PIN, simply press return at the PUK prompt.
			</para>
			<para>
				To set a label for this PIN object (which can be used by applications to display
				a meaningful prompt to the user), use the <option>--label</option> command line option.
			</para>
		</refsect2>

		<refsect2>
			<title>Key generation</title>
			<para>
				<command>pkcs15-init</command> lets you generate a new key and store it on the card.
				You can do this using:
			</para>
			<para>
				<command>pkcs15-init --generate-key " keyspec " --auth-id " nn</command>
			</para>
			<para>
				where <option>keyspec</option> describes the algorithm and length of the
				key to be created, such as <option>rsa/512</option>. This will create a 512 bit
				RSA key. Currently, only RSA key generation is supported. Note that cards
				usually support just a few different key lengths. Almost all cards will support
				512 and 1024 bit keys, some will support 768 or 2048 as well.
			</para>
			<para>
				<option>nn</option> is the ID of a user PIN installed previously, e.g. 01.
			</para>
			<para>
				In addition to storing the private portion of the key on the card,
				<command>pkcs15-init</command> will also store the the public portion of the
				key as a PKCS #15 public key object.
			</para>
		</refsect2>

		<refsect2>
			<title>Private Key Download</title>
			<para>
				You can use a private key generated by other means and download it to the card.
				For instance, to download a private key contained in a file named
				<emphasis>okir.pem</emphasis>, which is in PEM format, you would use
			</para>
			<para>
				<command>pkcs15-init --store-private-key okir.pem --id 45 --auth-id 01</command>
			</para>
			<para>
				In addition to storing the private portion of the key on the card,
				<command>pkcs15-init</command> will also store the the public portion of the
				key as a PKCS #15 public key object.
			</para>
			<para>
				Note the use of the <option>--id</option> option. The current
				<command>pkcs15</command> profile defines two key templates, one for
				authentication (key ID 45), and one for non-repudiation purposes (key ID 46).
				Other key templates will probably be added in the future. Note that if you don't
				specify a key ID, <command>pkcs15-init</command> will pick just the first key
				template defined by the profile.
			</para>
			<para>
				In addition to the PEM key file format, <command>pkcs15-init</command> also 
				supports DER encoded keys, and PKCS #12 files. The latter is the file format
				used by Netscape Navigator (among others) when exporting certificates to
				a file. A PKCS #12 file usually contains the X.509 certificate corresponding
				to the private key. If that is the case, <command>pkcs15-init</command> will
				store the certificate instead of the public key portion.
			</para>
		</refsect2>

		<refsect2>
			<title>Public Key Download</title>
			<para>
				You can also download individual public keys to the card using the
				<option>--store-public-key</option> option, which takes a filename as an
				argument. This file is supposed to contain the public key. If you don't
				specify a key file format using the <option>--format</option> option,
				<command>pkcs15-init</command> will assume PEM format. The only other
				supported public key file format is DER.
			</para>
			<para>
				Since the corresponding public keys are always downloaded automatically
				when generating a new key, or when downloading a private key, you will
				probably use this option only very rarely.
			</para>
		</refsect2>

		<refsect2>
			<title>Certificate Download</title>
			<para>
				You can download certificates to the card using the
				<option>--store-certificate</option> option, which takes a filename as
				an argument. This file is supposed to contain the PEM encoded X.509
				certificate.
			</para>
		</refsect2>

		<refsect2>
			<title>Downloading PKCS #12 bags</title>
			<para>
				Most browsers nowadays use PKCS #12 format files when you ask them to
				export your key and certificate to a file. <command>pkcs15-init</command>
				is capable of parsing these files, and storing their contents on the
				card in a single operation. This works just like storing a private key,
				except that you need to specify the file format:
			</para>
			<para>
				<command>pkcs15-init --store-private-key okir.p12 --format pkcs12 --auth-id
				01</command>
			</para>
			<para>
				This will install the private key contained in the file <emphasis>okir.p12</emphasis>,
				and protect it with the PIN referenced by authentication ID <emphasis>01</emphasis>.
				It will also store any X.509 certificates contained in the file, which is
				usually the user certificate that goes with the key, as well as the CA certificate.
			</para>
