		<title>Description</title>
		<para>
			The <command>pkcs15-init</command> utility for PKCS #15 smart card
			personalization is controlled via profiles. When starting, it will read two
			such profiles at the moment, a generic application profile, and a card
			specific profile. The generic profile must be specified on the command line,
			while the card-specific file is selected based on the type of card detected.
		</para>
		<para>
			The generic application profile defines general information about the card
			layout, such as the path of the application DF, various PKCS #15 files within
			that directory, and the access conditions on these files. It also defines
			general information about PIN, key and certificate objects. Currently, there
			is only one such generic profile, <command>pkcs15.profile</command>.
		</para>
		<para>
			The card specific profile contains additional information required during
			card initialization, such as location of PIN files, key references etc.
			Profiles currently reside in <command>@pkgdatadir@</command>
		</para>
