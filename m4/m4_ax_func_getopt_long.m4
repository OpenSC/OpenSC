# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_FUNC_GETOPT_LONG
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Check for getopt_long support.
#
#   This assume that the standard getopt.h file (from GNU libc) is available
#   as src/common/compat_getopt.h. If needed, this file will be linked as getopt.h, but
#   we want to default to the system's getopt.h file. (See
#   http://sources.redhat.com/ml/automake/2000-09/msg00041.html for an
#   explanation about why using the system's getopt.h file is important.)
