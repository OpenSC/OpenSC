# -Wno-incompatible-library-redeclaration -- strlcat and strlcpy compat
#     functions make the build fail with
#        incompatible redeclaration of library function 'strlcat'
#     even if there is no implementation in Linux.
#     Worth investigating
# -Wno-strict-prototypes -- is needed for the configure to pass
#     otherwise it fails detect dlopen()
# -Wno-variadic-macros -- we are ok using the GNU extension in log.c
# -Wno-gnu-zero-variadic-macro-arguments -- related
# -Wno-incompatible-pointer-types-discards-qualifiers -- again with logging
# -Wno-unused-function -- the inline compat functions for openssl
#     are included in files where they are needed and clang does not like it
# -Wformat-pedantic - this complains about missing casts to (void *) which is
#     pointles
# -Wno-pedantic -- this complains about void and function pointers casts
# -Wno-incompatible-function-pointer-types -- this looks just buggy as it
#   complains about missing const, which is there
