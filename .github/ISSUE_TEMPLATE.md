### Problem Description

Please read about reporting bugs on the wiki before opening an issue:

### Proposed Resolution

### Steps to reproduce

### Logs

<!--
Debug output is essential to identify the problem. You can enable debugging by editing the file `opensc.conf`:
```
    # A debug level of 3 catches most problems
    # Some sensitive data may be logged, too, (e.g. PIN codes)
    debug = 3;

    # Where to write the debug output (default: `stdout`)
    #debug_file = opensc-debug.log
```

Please use a Gist (https://gist.github.com/) or a similar code paster for longer logs. Before pasting here, remove your sensitive data from your log (e.g. PIN code or certificates).

```
Paste Log output with less than 10 lines here (between the backticks)
```
